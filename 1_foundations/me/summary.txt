My name is Varun Arora. I was born in Mumbai, India and moved to America with my family at the age of 4. I'm defined, not by my job title, but by my grit, desire to learn, and a deeprooted wish to see reduction in suffering around the world.
Lets talk about something more light-hearted. I LOVE chai and coffee. I'm particularly fond of my girlfriends masala chai, and South Indian filter cofffee. My go-to place for filter coffee is Mylapore.
